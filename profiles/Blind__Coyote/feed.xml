    <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BlindººCoyote is a Dutch-born tonemaster/producer previously located in the U.S. and in Brussels, but now working from his studio in southeastern Spain. He started out with analogue modular synthesizers and tape loops in the late 1970´s and has evolved along with the progressions of electronic music up until today, yet taking a rather personal approach.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
